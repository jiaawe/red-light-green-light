  "selected_configuration": "ew_straight_priority",
  "duration_seconds": 120,
  "justification": "The configuration 'ew_straight_priority' was selected due to the highest current traffic volume for East-West movements, with 103 vehicles in the East-West direction compared to 90 vehicles in the North-South direction. This configuration allows for both Eastbound and Westbound vehicles to move straight and turn left, maximizing throughput. Given that there are no pedestrians currently waiting, the focus is on vehicle flow. The duration of 120 seconds was chosen as it is appropriate for the high volume of vehicles, ensuring that the East-West traffic is efficiently managed without excessive waiting times. Additionally, the previous configuration 'ns_straight_priority' has been used recently, so this choice helps maintain fairness by alternating directions. The waiting time penalty is not applicable here since the last configuration was not heavily weighted towards the East-West direction.",
